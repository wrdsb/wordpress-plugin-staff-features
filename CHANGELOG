# 1.6.0
* Add "School Data" module
** This module replaces the current "WRDSB School Team Reporting" website on the Staff Intranet.
** This module includes the ability for each school to enter, edit, and manage six types of school-related data:
*** Fire Drill Schedule
*** Emergency Response Team
*** Evacuation Sites
*** IPRC
*** SCIS Team
*** Workplace Inspection Team
** Each type of data has its own form for data collection.
** The forms are "regular HTML forms", replacing the current Ninja Forms forms in the school teams website.
** Only authorized personnel from a given school can edit that school's data
** Data is collected through these forms and reported to those who need it, in a manner similar to the school teams website it replaces.

# 1.5.0
* Add "Asset Assignment" module
** This is the end-to-end solution requested for device assignment at ECPP.
** This module includes the ability to enter, edit, and manage "Asset Assignments" (similar to the existing "Device Loans" available to otherÂ schools/sites).
** This new module brings forward all the same features as the "Device Loans" module, with an updated data model, as well as the ability to enter and edit data directly through a school's Handbook, rather than entering new data through a Google Form while not being able to edit existing data at all.
** In this release, this new module is available only to ECPP staff.
** Only administrators of the ECPP Handbook on the Staff Intranet can create and edit data.
** All members of the ECPP Handbook can view submitted data.
